[Startup Names](http://nicovalencia.github.io/startup-names/)
=============================================================

Rachel and Bing had a great idea to combine startup names by chaining prefix and suffix compounds.
Hargobind and I developed an urge to write some code.

Setup
=====

Install Node.js & NPM, then:

`npm install`
`node scrape.js` - will run the scraper against CrunchBase's company index.
`node words.js` - will create a words.json file from `/usr/share/dict/words`.
